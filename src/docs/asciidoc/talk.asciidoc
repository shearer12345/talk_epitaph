== A tiny bit about Epitaph

____
an interview-based soundscape, presented via a mobile app, to be experienced in cemeteries. The app presents personal anecdotes and fragments of life stories of the dead, triggered by proximity to a grave. These stories are captured through interviews with the families and the communities of those who have passed on.
